# TAIM Heatwave Prediction Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the TAIM Heatwave Prediction Challenge. The project focuses on predicting heatwave occurrences and intensity using time series data from various sources, including India's Bhuvan Satellite Data and NASA's POWER API.

## Key Features
- Developed Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU) to forecast temperature up to one year in advance.
- Achieved an average error of less than 2Â°C in heatwave predictions.
- Applied advanced data mining and feature engineering techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, pandas, numpy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the model training script to predict heatwaves based on the provided dataset.
